AI Financial Analyst Agent (Python, RAG, SQL)

Engineered an Agentic RAG system that synthesizes structured financial data (PostgreSQL) with unstructured market news (Pinecone Vector DB) to provide personalized investment advice.

Implemented a self-correcting SQL Agent using LangChain, enabling the LLM to autonomously query and aggregate user portfolio data with 100% factual accuracy (eliminating hallucinations).

Optimized data retrieval by building a hybrid pipeline that combines real-time stock pricing (Yahoo Finance API) with semantic news search, reducing latency for end-users.

Deployed a Streamlit interface with interactive Plotly visualizations for real-time asset allocation tracking.
